              <p class="validation-sub">
                  I have used HTML5 and CSS before, so a lot of things were not new to me fortunately. I have used my skills in the past to create basic websites that were designed for desktop/computer users only. 
                  <br><br>Keeping my skills in mind, I was strongly encouraged for this assignment, and by professionals to design for mobile first. This was not an easy task as I have not designed primarily for mobiles before, therefore I have faced challenges that I did not think I would face.
                  <br><br>Developing for a single platform, especially if it’s for desktop only isn’t an extremely hard task. However, developing and designing something that can and will work on mobiles, tablets and computers is always a hard task as you have to make the whole front-end look good from tiny screens up to 28”+ screen sizes while also having the same functionalities.
                  <br><br>I had to enhance the website to work on all screen sizes and have the same functionalities across all platforms. To do this, I have used a few websites to look for answers (such as stackoverflow) and enhance the website to not only look good, but to also follow the industry standards that are used in 2017 and in the future.
                  <br><br>I have also explored about 30-50 websites to get an idea about how they are built. I have taken a look at their source code to discover what the best practices and the industry standards are for those companies. I have then forked some of the practices and combined it into my work. This has helped me by making my job a lot easier, saving me a lot of time and effort that it would have otherwise take me to finish.
                  <br><br><strong>Before starting any work however, I have created some wireframes to understand how I plan on making my website and how I plan on designing it. This kept me informed of the details and layout that I have set out for myself to follow.</strong>

              <img class="validation-index" src="images/validation-index.jpg" alt="Validation of Homepage">
              <p class="validation-description">For the homepage (index), i have received 7 Errors. One of the errors include the "frameborder". The reason I have not removed it is because I was unable to fix it with CSS code and styling, therefore I have decided to leave it in. Though this is the old-standard, it is fortunately still supported in all browsers and can be displayed accordingly.
                  For the form (number 4 on list), I have received a few errors that I was unable to justify and fix. The form is in fully working order and is only missing the function bit that would make it work.
                   </p>

              <img class="validation-comparison" src="images/validation-comparison.jpg" alt="Validation of Comparison">
              <p class="validation-description">There were no errors detected on the page "Comparison".</p>

              <img class="validation-validation" src="images/validation-validation.jpg" alt="Validation of Validation">
              <p class="validation-description">The validation page had image elements in the Unordered List (ul) tag section. This is due to the fact that the (ul) tag doesn’t allow (img) contents to be placed in the same area, however removing it resulted in a bad design, therefore I have decided to stick with it.<br>
                In terms of support, it is supported on all devices and platforms and the user will not notice any errors when normally viewing the page.
                </p>

              <img class="validation-specialisation" src="images/validation-specialisation.jpg" alt="Validation of Specialisation">
              <p class="validation-description">On the Specialisation page, the same error occurred as on the homepage (index) with the iframe tag/content.<br> 
                  The reason why I haven’t removed the border from the iframe tag is because I was unable to make it disappear with CSS, therefore I have not found an issue that it would cause to leave it in.
                  </p>

              <img class="validation-glossary" src="images/validation-glossary.jpg" alt="Validation of Glossary">
              <p class="validation-description">There were no errors detected on the page "Glossary".</p>

              <img class="validation-mgp" src="images/validation-mgp.jpg" alt="Validation of Models of Good Practice and User Interface">
              <p class="validation-description">On the “Models of Good Practice (MGP) and User Interface (UI)” page, I have received the very same errors as on the validation page.<br>
                  I was unable to re-construct the page and make it display in the way I wanted it to look, therefore I strongly believed that these changes would not be necessary. I decided to leave it with the errors as it will still display nicely on all devices and platforms.
